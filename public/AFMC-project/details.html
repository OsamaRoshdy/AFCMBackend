          <p>We were honored by Dr. Mostafa Yehia the Dermatology Consultant and the Founder and Head of Mycology Unit, Al-Haud Elmarsud Hospital. He enriched the audience with his fungal infection cases presentation. A “hands on” work shop was held on the same day in Microbiology laboratory, illustrating the conventional methods used to diagnose fungal skin infections. The event aimed at encouraging healthcare providers to “THINK FUNGUS” when symptoms of infection are not cleared off with treatment, since it is a new era of microbial virtue that eventually gain more armory and became more virulent and resistant to known antifungal drugs.
